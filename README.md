        "Consider a system for a Vigenere cipher system. The system consists of a matrix which is filled with a set of predefined values (even though it is normally considered           for strings, we take it for numbers). The matrix is filled like:
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
        1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
        2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
        3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2
        4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
        5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4
        6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
        7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
        8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
        9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
        Enter a number. Then take adjacent digits and lookup the table with 1st digit forming the row number and 2nd digit forming the column number. Then display the digit at           that location. Repeat it for the rest of the number."

53.   Write a function implementation to reverse a string without using any library function
54.   Write a program to implement a sorting system for numbers using functions
55.   "Write a user-defined function that finds the square root of a number without using any library function. The square root can be found out like below.
      Consider 40. 36<40<49
      So, square root lies between 6 and 7. Take the average. You get 6.5. The square is 42.25.
